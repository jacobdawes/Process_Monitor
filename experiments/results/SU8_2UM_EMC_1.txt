Experiment#: 1
Date: 03/17/19

Deposit/pattern 2 um SU8 on EMC substrate for 3 wafers.


  O2 plasma ash for 2 minutes

  Dehydration bake:  10 minutes at  95 C

  Spin: SU8_2002 for 30 seconds at 3000 rpm with acceleration of 300 rpm/s

  Soft bake:  3 minutes at  90 C

  Exposure:  65 mJ (currently  20 s)

  Post exposure bake:  3 minutes at  C

  Develop: 2 minutes in SU8 developer

  Hard bake (optional): 30 minutes at 165 C




RESULTS

Wafer 1
Major Delamination: y
Delamination Length: 5

Wafer 2
Major Delamination: n
Delamination Length: 19

Wafer 3
Major Delamination: y
Delamination Length: 13


SUMMARY
Major delamination occured on 66 % of the wafers
Average delamination length was 13 um
